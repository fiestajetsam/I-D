--- abstract

This document describes the use cases, requirements, and considerations that
should be factored in the design of a successor protocol to supercede version 4
of the NTP protocol {{!RFC5905}} presently referred to as NTP version 5
("NTPv5"). This document is non-exhaustive and does not in its current version
represent working group consensus.

# Introduction

NTP version 4 {{!RFC5905}} has seen active use for over a decade, and within
this time period the protocol has not only been extended to support new
requirements but also fallen victim to vulnerabilities that have made it used
for distributed denial of service (DDoS) amplification attacks.

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Use cases and existing deployments of NTP

There are several common scenarios for exxisting NTPv4 deployments; publicly
accessible NTP services such as the NTP Pool {{ntppool}} are used to offer clock
synchronisation for end users and embedded devices, ISP provided servers to
synchronise devices such as customer-premesis equipment where reduced accuracy
may be tollerable. Depending on the network and path these deployments may be
affected by variable latency as well as throttling or blocking by providers.

Data centres and cloud computing providers also have deployed and offer NTP
services both for internal use and for customers, particularly where the network
is unable to offer or does not require PTP {{IEEE-1588-2008}}. As these
deployments are less likely to be constrained by network latency or power the
potential for higher levels of accuracy and precision within the bounds of the
protocol are possible.

# Requirements

At a high level, NTPv5 should be a protocol that is capable of operating in both
local networks and also over public internet connections where packet loss,
delay, and even filtering may occur.

Timestamp resolution SHOULD either match or exceed NTPv4, and be extensible to
represent any specified timescale.

The protocol SHOULD NOT transmit time zone information and should focus on
providing clock synchronisation as TZDIST {{RFC7808}} already provides this
ability.

## IP affinity

Servers SHOULD have a new identifier that peers use as reference, this SHOULD
NOT be a FQDN, an IP address, or identifier tied to a certificate. Servers
SHOULD be able to migrate and change their identifiers as stratum topologies or
network configuration changes occur.

Clients SHOULD re-establish connections with servers at an interval to prevent
attempting to maintain connectivity to dead host and give network operators the
ability to move traffic away from IP addresses in a timely manner. This
functionality should also compliment having a "Kiss of Death" or similar message
from servers.

## Algorithms

Algorithms describing functions such as clock filtering, selection and
clustering SHOULD be omitted from the specification; the specification should
instead only provide only what is necessary to describe protocol semantics and
normative behaviours.

The working group should consider creating a separate informational document to
describe an algorithm to assist with implementation, and to consider adopting
future documents which describe new algorithms as they are developed. Specifying
client algorithms separately from the protocol allows will allow NTPv5 to meet
the needs of applications with a variety of network properties and performance
requirements. It also allows for innovation in implementations without
sacrificing basic interoperability.

## Timescales

Support SHOULD be available for other timescales in addition to UTC - this
should include, but not limited to the use of TAI or Modified Julian Date as
defined in {{I-D.ietf-ntp-roughtime}}, however UTC SHALL be the default
timescale and MUST be supported by all implementations. Consideration should be
made to include listing the supported timescales either as part of specific IANA
parameter registry, or as part of the extension registry.

## Leap seconds

The specification or the protocol SHOULD be explicit about when a leap
second is being applied, and the protocol should allow for transmiting an
upcoming leap second ahead of the day it is to be applicable. Nevertheless,
due to network delays and the polling interval, applications with NTP clients
will need to manage the leap second event at their local clock.

### Leap second smearing

Server responses SHOULD include not only an indicator as to wether the server
supports smearing, but also if the current time being transmitted is smeared.
The protocol may also transmit the start/end or duration of the smearing ahead
of time. It MUST be possible for clients to determine the unsmeared time of the
timescale.

## Backwards compatibility to NTS and NTPv4

The support for compatibility with other protocols SHOULD NOT prevent addressing
issues that have previous caused issues in deployments or cause ossification of
the protocol. Protocol ossification MUST be addressed to prevent existing NTPv4
deployments which incorrectly respond to clients posing as NTPv5 from causing
issues. Forward prevention of ossification (for a potential NTPv6 protocol in
the future) SHOULD also be taken into consideration.

The model for backward compatibility is servers that support mutliple versions
NTP and send a response in the same version as the request. This does not
preclude high stratum servers from acting as a client in one version of NTP and
a server in another.

## Extensibility

To provide the protocol MUST have the capability to be extended. The
specification should specify that implementations MUST ignore unknown
extensions. Unknown extensions received by a server from a lower stratum server
SHALL not be added to response messages sent by the server receiving these
extensions.

# IANA Considerations

Considerations should be made about the future of the existing IANA registry
for NTPv4 parameters. If NTPv5 becomes incompatible with these parameters a new
registry SHOULD be created.

# Security Considerations

Encryption and authentication MUST be provided by the protocol specification as
a default and MUST be resistent to downgrade attacks. The encryption used must
have agility, allowing for the protocol to update as more secure cryptography
becomes known and vulnerabilities are discovered.

The specification MAY consider leaving room for middleboxes which may
deliberately modify packets in flight for legitimate purposes. Thought must be
given around how this will be incorporated into any applicable trust model.
Downgrading attacks that could lead to an adversary disabling or removing
encryption or authentication MUST NOT be possible in the design of the protocol.

Detection and reporting of server malfeasence SHOULD remain out of scope of this
specification as {{!I-D.ietf-ntp-roughtime}} already provides this capability as
a core functionality of the protocol.
